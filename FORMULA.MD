# Formula to sign every string

We use a private formula to sign every copy of "Goodnight, World" . However, you can go to `/src/<gameversion>/output.txt/` to verify your string. Alternatively, to run the game, you will need a verified key. Download the `output_script.8xp` to your calculator and run it once. This way, when the game invokes a key, you will be able to run it.

# Example of a signed copy

We ran the command `prgmSIGN`
Output :
```
